# VOICE-OF-CUSTOMER
This Repository contains the codes for implementing the sentimental analysis for the dataset of customer feedback reviews.

The codes were run on the 'Reviews.csv,' which contains customer feedback reviews and can be downloaded from Kaggle from this website "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews."

Two Models have been implemented to apply the sentimental analysis on the dataset: VADER, RoBERTa, and word cloud have been plotted in the codes.
